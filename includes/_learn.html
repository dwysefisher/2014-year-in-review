					<p>The four-story, 17,270-square-foot facility includes a state-of-the-art organic and inorganic chemistry lab, a tiered multimedia classroom with the latest teleconferencing technology, four classrooms, a seminar room, faculty offices, a study lounge and more. It is an addition to the existing Vennum-Binkley Science Hall erected in 1916. Core Construction of Morton is the general contractor.</p>
					<p>The building is designed to achieve certification for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design based on standards of the U.S. Green Buildings Council for its environmentally friendly construction and design, according to Vice President of Finance and Facilities Marc Pasteris. Energy-efficient components are masonry construction, roof design and materials, windows and light pollution control, storm water design, water use reduction, optimization of energy performance through equipment selection and system controls, construction waste management, recycled and regionally purchased materials, landscape design and alternative transportation opportunities such as bicycle storage and changing rooms.</p>
					<p>The building includes an outdoor area for research on science-related subjects, including native plant restoration, implications for above-ground and below-ground biodiversity and the economics of green infrastructure. The area includes deep-rooted native plants for capturing and cleansing storm water from the building, allowing water to infiltrate to the aquifer below instead of into the storm water drainage system, which could cause flooding and problems at the waste treatment plant, according to assistant professor of environmental studies Renée Mullen Ph.D. Funds for the outdoor area were donated by Eureka College history professor emeritus Richard Sanders of Eureka.Sanders also donated $3 million toward the construction of the building, marking the largest single gift in Eureka College history.</p>
					<p>&#8220;The importance of Dr. Sanders&#8217; support for this project cannot be overstated,&#8221; Vice President of Institutional Advancement Michael Murtagh said. &#8220;Dr. Sanders is a difference-maker who has helped to transform Eureka College, and in doing so will help provide students with the opportunity to become the best versions of themselves.&#8221; Eureka College trustees have pledged $1.5 million toward the project.</p>
					<p>A state-of-the-art chemistry lab is equipped for optimally safe student use, with eight high-performance, energy-efficient fume hoods and a larger teacher demonstration fume hood. Spacious fully equipped lab benches provide ample room for student experimentation, according to division chair for math and science Paul Small Ph.D. Adjacent to the lab is an instrument room with a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer, an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, a high-performance liquid chromatography unit and a rotary evaporator, among other instruments.</p>
					<p>The equipment will enhance the college&#8217;s pre-professional programs, including pre-medicine, pre-veterinary and pre-pharmacy, Small said. &#8220;This lab is specifically designed for student use. Often at other schools, such state-of-the-art labs are reserved for specific research projects, but our lab will be available for all of our advanced level chemistry courses, whether they be organic, inorganic, medicinal, biochemistry, thermodynamics, kinetics or quantitative analysis,&#8221; he said. Eureka College chemistry professors Kevin Stillman Ph.D. and Yuxiang Zhao M.D. Ph.D. both have industry and research experience in addition to teaching experience, according to Small.</p>
					<p>Classes from almost every academic division will be held in the building. Besides classes in science, computer science and mathematics, the building will accommodate classes in education, business, English, Spanish, sociology, psychology, communication, first-year and senior seminars and the academic honors program.</p>
					<p>The addition, which doubles the size of the original building, is part of an ongoing project to upgrade Vennum-Binkley Hall. The original building was named Vennum Science Hall in honor of donors Frank and Sadie Vennum. It was renamed Vennum-Binkley Hall in 1984 to honor Dr. Stephen and Lois Binkley, graduates of 1934. Stephen Binkley was a research scientist in the laboratory whose director won the Nobel Prize for discovering Vitamin K. Binkley taught chemistry at Eureka College from 1972 to 1985. </p>
					<p> The projects are part of the Ivy Project: Historic Campus Constructions, which includes more than $15.7 million in recent new construction and renovations.</p>

			<p class="first-paragraph">Eureka College is expecting its second-largest incoming freshman class this fall. The class should total approximately 170 students when classes begin Aug. 27, according to Registrar Scott Wignall. He said that is up from 138 first-year students last year. The record high was 174 in 2010.</p>
			<p>A higher percentage of freshmen are choosing to live on campus this year. Approximately 90 percent of freshmen will live in campus housing compared to 78 percent last year.</p>
			<p>The college is in position to have a record-high number of students living on campus. Approximately 400 students are projected to live in residence halls compared to 350 last year. The record was 393 in 2010 and 2011. The college has room for all the students, Director of Residence Life Lisa Fischer said.</p>
			<p>Overall enrollment is projected to be approximately 655. Last year’s enrollment was 692.</p>
			<p>&#8220;Many colleges and universities across Illinois and the nation are experiencing enrollment declines,&#8221; said Dean of Admissions Kurt Krile. &#8220;Eureka College attributes its recent decline to large graduating classes and fewer part-time students.&#8221;</p>
			<p>Based on current recruitment efforts, the college is optimistic about future enrollment growth, Krile said.</p>
			<p>Official enrollment numbers won’t be available until the tenth day of classes.  </p>

				<p>The family of the late Julia Colorado, a Eureka College Spanish professor who died in October, has donated funds to create a scholarship in her memory.</p>
				<p>The Celestino Colorado family of Edwards donated $45,000 to establish the Julia Colorado Memorial Scholarship. The funds will be combined with $5,000 in memorial gifts from Colorado’s students, co-workers and friends to endow a permanent scholarship to support international travel experiences for Eureka College students. Colorado taught at Eureka College for 19 years.</p>
				<p>“Eureka College serves as a launch pad for global leadership for our students,” said Eureka College President J. David Arnold. “We continue to hear stories of how Señora Colorado was the inspiring factor for many students to embark on international journeys.  With this incredibly personal gift from the Colorado family, Julia’s legacy will continue to influence global experiences for Eureka’s students.”</p>

						<h4>&lsquo;It called me&rsquo;</h4>
						<h5>Junior Colton Lott walks Spain's 500-mile Camino de Santiago de Compostela</h5>
						<h6>by Colton Lott</h6>
<!--						<img src="<!-- @path colton-lott.jpg --*>" class="right centered inline-image" style="padding-left: 1em;" />--*>
						<p class="right">Pilgrimage is an ancient practice developed in several religions, but one that Christianity at one time seemed at risk of losing. My generation, called the &ldquo;Millennials,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gen Y&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Selfie Generation,&rdquo; in between being bashed by generations more mature, has been taking interest in spiritual disciplines such as pilgrimage. Whether the history books call the group of people I am sociologically linked to the &ldquo;greatest generation&rdquo; or the &ldquo;generation-to-take-a-million-duck-face-mirror-selfies-with-a-flashlight&rdquo; does not matter &ndash; the fact remains that pilgrimage has a certain calling. And it called me.</p>
						<p>I am standing at the tip of Cabo Finisterre, which 1,000 years ago was considered the most western point in the world...for the people there it was the end of the world. An awesome moment, indeed!</p>
						<p>I am a junior at Eureka College and a fellow in the Disciples Leadership Program. Among the benefits that the fellowship gifts me are two ministry experiences anywhere in the world. I decided to unite my major (philosophy and religion) with my minor (Spanish) and undertake the Camino de Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain last summer.</p>
						<p>I knew that the process of the pilgrimage had the power to change my life in drastic ways. I underestimated just how much I needed changing. After walking over 500 miles, getting blisters on nine of my toes (gracias a Dios that the 10th was spared), and seeing more of a country in 35 days than I could ever see from a bus window, I realized that I, like millions of pilgrims before me, had epiphanies and revelations about my life, including:</p>
						<ul class="no-bullet">
							<li>I needed to live with less guilt and fewer material things.</li>
							<li>My spiritual being needed more time for expression, and more than anything I decided that I had to stop worshipping busyness. Worshipping busyness is a veritable addiction that I am still trying to work through, four months post-pilgrimage.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Eureka College sent me on a life-changing experience of which I could not immediately and accurately guess the implications. I highly doubted this could go on a resume, and I certainly had no clue what I would learn. However &ndash; and this is the beauty of Eureka College &ndash; I was allowed to go because exploration and knowing is at the heart of the liberal arts experience.</p>
						<p>I walked 15 or more miles a day for five weeks. I got to know myself in a way that I never had before. During those long days of nothing but walking, I had to finally slow down and live for the sake of living. Often in education we become encapsulated with the idea that we have to know &ldquo;stuff.&rdquo; Through this opportunity I was able to know me. Eureka College not only encourages me to pick a major that might bring home the bacon (although that is a perk) but also insists that students who walk &lsquo;neath the elms know themselves. I fully believe that there is no greater gift that an institution can give to the community of learners than the vow to educate in this significant way.</p>

						<h4>London means business for Eureka College, Bradley University students</h4>
						<h5>by Michele Lehman</h5>
						<p>Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and Buckingham Palace are among landmarks tourists flock to see when visiting London. But Eureka College and Bradley University students and professors were more excited about visiting less-popular sites when they made their trip across the Atlantic last spring.</p>
						<p>&quot;The students&#39; No. 1 favorite was Lloyd&#39;s of London,&quot; said Eureka College associate professor of business administration Marge Rubash, who helped organize the trip for business students. Lloyd&#39;s, the 325-year-old insurance pioneer, is the world&#39;s leading market for specialist insurance, and the students &quot;could visualize themselves working there with careers in risk management,&quot; Rubash said. On a private tour, students learned about the roles of the underwriters who were working as the group walked through the building. Several students inquired about internships, which are available on a very competitive basis, Rubash added.</p>
						<p>A visit to the Bank of England also was high on the list for the business- and finance-minded scholars, who also enjoyed teatime at The Ritz, the U.S. Embassy, Parliament, the British Museum, a theater production and Greenwich, where they stood with one foot on either side of the International Date Line.</p>
						<p>&quot;We always had a purpose for visiting each site on this trip, which was educational, with an experiential approach,&quot; said Rubash, who is coordinator of the college&#39;s International Studies Program. &quot;We met for class every day and then when out to explore the various locations.&quot;</p>
						<p>It was the perfect balance of class time and exploring, according to senior business administration and accounting major Megan Huette. &quot;I&#39;ve never been out of the United States before, so having the opportunity to experience a different culture was amazing.&quot; The highlight of her trip, Huette said, was The Ritz, where the students experienced traditional British teatime. &quot;We really got to experience the culture, dressing up, enjoying high tea and just discussing our experiences so far. For all of the students, it was something we&#39;ll never forget.&quot;</p>
						<p>While fun, trips abroad also benefit participants as students and as future employees, Rubash said. &quot;Study abroad always broadens horizons, and often students report that they learned more about themselves while traveling. And, in today&#39;s world, most employees will need experiences beyond their home state in order to grow and prosper in the business sector.&quot;</p>
						<p>Huette concurs: &quot;This trip benefited me as a student because I can now talk about my experiences and relate them to subjects we discuss in class. Also, as a future employee it will be an asset because I&#39;ve experienced adapting to different cultures and had to get along with others in an unfamiliar country.&quot;</p>
						<p>By partnering with Bradley University the group gained access to some sites, like Lloyd&#39;s, which sets a minimum number for a tour. Another benefit of the partnership: &quot;New friendships were made, and we all learned from each other,&quot; Rubash said.</p>
						<p>The trip will be offered again May 22&ndash;June 6 for $4,100 for three credit hours. Scholarships are available for the first seven to register.</p>
						<p>Another upcoming study abroad opportunity will be a Shakespeare-themed trip to England March 8&ndash;15, during spring break. Led by associate professor of English Jessica Barr and associate professor of theater Holly Rocke, highlights will include theater productions, acting workshops and tours of theaters and sites associated with renowned authors. For more information, go to <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/arts">www.eureka.edu/arts.</a></p>
						<p>&quot;We are extremely pleased to offer these learning experiences, and there is an increasing demand for them,&quot; Rubash said.</p>
						<p>Huette added: &quot;I would like to see Eureka College do trips like these more often. I know some people in our group were skeptical about going at first, but I know we would all do it again in a second. These types of trips are perfect for people who want to study abroad but don&#39;t want to go for a long period of time or spend a lot of money.&quot;</p>
						<p>Last year alone, EC students studied abroad and completed internships and mentorships in 21 countries and 13 states.</p>

			<p>Three committees were tasked with conceptualizing Eureka College's future strategic direction. Each committee brought members of the college community together to prepare a detailed White Paper on each topic area. The papers detail the College's best thoughts on achieving excellence in learning, service and leadership. The papers summarize relevant research and theoretical literature and the process generated inquiry, reflection and discussion about tangible and unique methods to achieve our shared vision.</p> 
			
			<p>"The white papers encourage us to ask important questions about our institution's future: How do we move forward and honor our heritage? What does it mean for us to be a liberal arts and sciences institution in the 21st century? We were founded by abolitionists and equally educated men and women; are there underserved populations of students we should be reaching? How <em>can</em> we make the Eureka College experience accessible for them?"<i><span style="font-size:0.9em"> ~ Dr. Ann Fulop</span></i><p>
