			<h3 class="first-paragraph subheader">The Board of Trustees voted to freeze tuition and fees at this year's rates for next academic year. The freeze applies to current and incoming students.</h3>
			
			<p>"Illinois' recession was more severe than the nation's as a whole, and our immediate region's economic recovery has been occurring more slowly," said Eureka College President J. David Arnold, citing information from Moody's 2013 Economic Forecast. "Since a large portion of Eureka College students are from Illinois and they are dealing with this economic reality, we are committing to a partnership with our students and their families to ensure their college experience remains affordable and accessible," Arnold said.</p>

							<p><a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/tuition-fees/">Tuition for full-time students</a> in fall 2014 will be $10,030 per semester or $20,060 for the academic year. For most students, the cost is reduced through institutional aid as well as state and federal educational grants. Incoming freshmen receive an average of $15,000 to $18,000 in financial aid, which greatly reduces the cost to attend. This is the second time in the last 10 years that the college has frozen tuition.</p>
							
							<p>"Eureka College has always been committed to keeping our exceptional educational experience affordable and accessible," said Dean of Admissions Kurt Krile. "Since our founding in 1855, the college has consistently offered some of the lowest tuition rates among Illinois private colleges. This focus allows us to provide a private, liberal arts education to a diverse student base, including first-generation students, which improves the educational and economic capacity of our state."</p>
							
							<p>In addition to the tuition freeze, the college has developed a <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/scholarships">new institutional aid process</a> in an effort to provide a straightforward approach for students and their families. Academic scholarships are now calculated based on two categories: a student's high school grade point average and their ACT exam score. Additional scholarships, called engagement awards, will be given to students who show excellence in areas like community service, leadership and the fine and performing arts.</p>
							
							<p>"We are being intentional about the type of student body we are creating, and by revamping our scholarship structure, we are able to better incentivize students who fit with the Eureka College ethos of learning, service and leadership," said Director of Marketing and Communications Corrie Heck. "The continued significant investment in institutional aid and the freeze in tuition ensures that Eureka College students are graduating with a world-renowned private college education and relatively low levels of loan debt."</p>

				<p>EC marked the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage in Illinois with a commemorative program featuring music, dance, poetry, dramatic readings and stories about Eureka College alumnae who were important in the women's suffrage movement.</p>
				<p>"Eureka College has a rich history linked to the suffrage movement, as reform-minded women and men from this institution promoted women's voting rights both in Illinois and across the nation," said Eureka College history professor Junius Rodriguez.</p>

							<p>The program featured two speakers who highlighted the century of progress and encourage those who will be the next generation of leaders. Annette Dyar Sherman, an alumna from the class of 1941, spoke about the tremendous expansion of opportunities for women and girls that she has witnessed in her lifetime. Rebecca "Becky" Weber of Metamora, who recently was installed as the national Director of Junior Clubs for the General Federation of Women's Clubs International, spoke about the expanded opportunities that exist today for girls and women and the outlook for progress in the years ahead.</p>
							
							<p>The story of expanded rights for women has always been central to the story of Eureka College, Rodriguez said. Eureka College was the first school in Illinois and the third in the nation to educate women on an equal basis with men, he said.</p> 
							<p>On June 26, 1913, Gov. Edward F. Dunne signed the Illinois Municipal Voting Act into law making Illinois the first state east of the Mississippi River to allow women to vote in local and presidential elections. Many Illinois women participated in suffrage events in Washington, D.C., to gain the right for women in the rest of the country. On Aug. 26, 1920, women across the nation received the right to vote with the final ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
							
							<p>Additionally, EC Assistant Professor of History Dr. Erika Quinn joined community leaders on PBS' At Issue to discuss the anniversary of women's suffrage.</p>

				<p>A young man needed to chop down a tree to create a clearing for the mighty railroad to pass through. If the railroad would come through his hometown, it promised to bring prosperity for his family and friends. However, the only way to bring down the trees would be the one tool he had, an ax. The man started swinging the ax with all of his might over and over again. He kept count the number of swings in his head. The more he swung that ax the more frustrated he got. He couldn't see the results after each strike and didn't see the immediate progress. He didn't know if he was gaining any ground or not. It seemed like a daunting task that would never be completed.</p>
				
				<p>While taking a much needed break, an older man approached and asked if he could be of assistance. The older man wanted to take a swing at the large tree. The younger man told him he'd hit the tree with his ax ninety-nine times with no luck and he felt like giving up. The young man didn't see the harm in humoring rhe older man and handed him his ax. The older man got into position and with one mighty swing, the giant tree came crashing down.</p>
				
				<p>The young man was in disbelief and looked at the older man as if to demand an explanation of how he knocked the tree down with one swing. He thought to himself, it must have been a trick or a special technique the man used to finally take down the tree. He confronted the old man, "I've been swinging that ax and hitting that tree for hours, ninety-nine times I've hit that tree and nothing happened. You took one swing and the tree fell after hitting it just once. How did you do that? You must tell me your secret."</p>
				
				<p><strong>The older man responded with a simple sentence before walking away. "Young man, it was not the hundredth swing of the ax that brought the tree down, it was the ninety-nine swings before it."</strong></p>

							<a href="#panel-ax">Read how Eureka College Athletics applies the #SwingtheAx mentality</a>
							<div id="panel-ax" class="content">	
							<p>The Eureka College Red Devils will call upon their rich history to unite under one common goal for the 2014-15 academic year. #SwingTheAx will be the rallying cry for the over 170 student-athetes at Eureka College, but it will also look to unite their fans, alumni, friends and student population.</p>
							<p>"#SwingTheAx is how I want everyone affiliated with our student-athletes to think," said Director of Athletics Steve Thompson as he rolled the initiative out to the student-athletes recently. "It seems so simple but it is much deeper to me, our student-athletes, and I hope our alums."</p>
							
							<p>In 1957 Eureka Alum and 40<sup>th</sup> President of the United States Ronald Reagan returned to deliver the commencement address. Towards the end of that speech Reagan said, "You today are smarter than we were. You are better educated and better informed than we were twenty-five years ago, and that is part of your heritage. You enjoy these added benefits because, more than 100 years ago near this very spot, a man PLUNGED AN AX into a tree and said; Here we will build a school for our children."</p>
							
							<p>"When I interviewed for the job in November I came across the Reagan speech and that line stuck in my head. It seemed like a great way to bring all of us together. Utilize Eureka's rich history and give everyone a rallying cry, bringing everyone together," Thompson continued.</p>
							
							<p>#SwingTheAx was then adapted with the parable of a young woodsman chopping down trees.</p>
							
							<p>#SwingTheAx applies to everyone involved. Student-athletes dedicating themselves in the classroom and in competition, faculty and staff working directly with our student-athletes to help them achieve their goals, and alumni and friends returning to campus for different events. Everything each of us do for the betterment of Eureka College Athletics is a swing of the ax and will work towards knocking the tree down.</p>
