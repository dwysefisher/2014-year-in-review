			<p>Eureka College history professor Junius Rodriguez presented a Dean's Lecture titled "Bearing Witness in Extraordinary Times" on October 21, 2014. The presentation traced the life stories and family histories of three African American students who enrolled at Eureka College in fall 1928. The students were part of the most racially diverse freshman class in the college's history up to that point. It was the freshman class that included Ronald Reagan of Dixon, a future president of the United States.</p>
			
			<p>Willie Sue Smith Stewart (1910-2011) of Paris, Texas, Eudell Watts Jr. (1907-1990) of Kewanee and William Howard Dee Wright (1903-1956) of Springfield, were educational pioneers, since higher education was a largely unattainable dream for most African American youth in the era of the Great Depression, Rodriguez said. The presentation provided a new understanding of the times and the educational community the students helped to fashion at Eureka College. "In spite of setbacks that each may have encountered along the way, these three students remained steadfast and true to the sense of self that their families had cultivated within them."</p>
			
			<p>At the invitation of Dr. Rodriguez, the College was honored to host the descendents of Wille Sue Smith Stewart and Eudell Watts Jr. on September 23.</p>

					<p>Today was a very historic day on the Eureka College campus as three special guests visited the campus for the first time ever. Harry Stewart and his son Sean (the son and grandson of Willie Sue Smith Stewart) and Eudell Watts III (the son of Eudell "Lump" Watts, Jr.) visited the campus to learn more about the world that their family members experienced at Eureka College in the late-1920s. Both Willie Sue Smith Stewart and Eudell Watts, Jr. (along with William Howard Dee Wright) were the three African American students who enrolled as freshmen in Fall Semester 1928, the same cohort that included future President Ronald W. Reagan. Stewart graduated with the Class of 1932 and became the first African American woman to earn a degree at Eureka College.</p>
					
					<p>The "princes" who visited today were able to tour the campus and visit the College Archives where they viewed documentary records from the time that their parents attended Eureka College. They also visited Olio Cemetery and other historic sites within the Eureka Community. They spoke with Dr. Junius Rodriguez who is doing research on the three African American educational pioneers who started their college education together in 1928. In the afternoon the group met with current Eureka College students for a question and answer session where they contrasted the world their parents experienced with the world of today.</p>

			<p>EC students, staff members and Sodexo employees are excited about their efforts to keep cardboard out of landfills. The "rECycle" program (pronounced re-E-C-cycle, with EC standing for Eureka College, of course) got underway over the summer months, and it is expected to divert approximately 10 tons of solid waste from landfills per year, according to senior special education major Robert Jacobs.</p>

							<p>Robert, who is president of Student Alliance for a Greener Environment, wrote a grant last year with  fellow student Kamrin Ruder, who graduated in May. The grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity’s Illinois Recycling Grants Program totaled $3,764 and was used to purchase three large metal recycling bins that will be placed near the Alumni Court residence hall, Dickinson Commons and the Burgoo. Each bin holds 4.5 cubic yards of cardboard.</p>
							
							<p>“Sodexo receives two large shipments of food each week,” Food Services Manager Kathy Moore said. “Our employees are happy to break down the boxes and place them in the recycling bin. It’s much better than the cardboard going into the trash dumpster,” Kathy said.</p>
							
							<p>Boxes from the bookstore and the mail room also will be recycled, as will cardboard from students in Alumni Court.</p>
							
							<p>The cardboard is given to a local recycling agency, the Association for the Developmentally Disabled of Woodford County in Eureka, which sells it to a fiber recycler.</p>
							
							<p>Besides the cardboard recycling, there will be a pilot program in place in the Admissions office to recycle other waste. Admissions staff each will have a desk-side recycling container consisting of a bin for recyclables and a smaller attached container for non-recyclable trash. Robert currently is weighing the trash generated by the department and said he is looking forward to calculating how much the trash is reduced once the desk-side recycling program is in place. The total expense for those bins was approximately <sup>$</sup>200, Robert said.</p>

Based on a parable teaching the value of hard work #SwingTheAx will be the rallying cry for the more than 170 student-athletes at Eureka College.<p>
				
				<p>"#SwingTheAx is how I want everyone affiliated with our student-athletes to think," said Director of Athletics Steve Thompson as he rolled the initiative out to the student-athletes this fall. "It seems so simple but it is much deeper to me, our student-athletes, and I hope our alums."</p>

								<p>A  young man needed to chop down a tree to create a clearing for the mighty railroad to pass through. If the railroad would come through his hometown, it promised to bring prosperity for his family and friends. However, the only way to bring down the trees would be the one tool he had, an ax. The man started swinging the ax with all of his might over and over again. He kept count the number of swings in his head. The more he swung that ax the more frustrated he got. He couldn't see the results after each strike and didn't see the immediate progress. He didn't know if he was gaining any ground or not. It seemed like a daunting task that would never be completed.</p>
								
								<p>While taking a much needed break, an older man approached and asked if he could be of assistance. The older man wanted to take a swing at the large tree. The younger man told him he'd hit the tree with his ax ninety-nine times with no luck and he felt like giving up. The young man didn't see the harm in humoring the older man and handed him his ax. The older man got into position and with one mighty swing, the giant tree came crashing down.</p>
								
								<p>The young man was in disbelief and looked at the older man as if to demand an explanation of how he knocked the tree down with one swing. He thought to himself, it must have been a trick or a special technique the man used to finally take down the tree. He confronted the old man, "I've been swinging that ax and hitting that tree for hours; ninety-nine times I've hit that tree and nothing happened. You took one swing and the tree fell after hitting it just once. How did you do that? You must tell me your secret."</p>
								
								<p>The older man responded with a simple sentence before walking away. "Young man, it was not the hundredth swing of the ax that brought the tree down, it was the ninety-nine swings before it."</p>
								
								<p>In 1957 Eureka Alum and 40<sup>th</sup> President of the United States Ronald Reagan returned to deliver the commencement address. Towards the end of that speech Reagan said, "You today are smarter than we were. You are better educated and better informed than we were twenty-five years ago, and that is part of your heritage. You enjoy these added benefits because, more than 100 years ago near this very spot, a man PLUNGED AN AX into a tree and said: Here we will build a school for our children."</p>
								
								<p>#SwingTheAx applies to everyone involved. Student-athletes dedicating themselves in the classroom and in competition, faculty and staff working directly with our student-athletes to help them achieve their goals, and alumni and friends returning to campus for different events. Everything we do for the betterment of Eureka College is a swing of the ax and will work towards knocking down the proverbial tree.</p>
