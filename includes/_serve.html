			<p>Eureka College has received a major gift from Glen and Polly Barton of Peoria to establish the Barton Fund. The fund is the first of its kind at Eureka College, as it supports three distinct areas of opportunities for students and faculty. It provides mentorships, scholarships and faculty fellowships to enhance and expand academic and service experiences.</p>
			<p>“Polly and I continue to be very impressed by the faculty and students at Eureka College,” Barton said. “We believe this is an excellent way to help sustain the good works of this fine, historic institution.”</p>
			<p>The gift addresses three important needs of Eureka College students and faculty members: support for student mentorships, support for student service scholarships and support for professional development for faculty members, according to Eureka College President J. David Arnold.</p>
			<p>“Eureka College sincerely thanks Glen and Polly Barton for providing these additional opportunities for our students and faculty to learn and serve others,” Arnold said.</p>
			<p>The Barton Mentorships support more than 20 mentorship opportunities annually for Ronald W. Reagan Fellows, Durward Sandifer Fellows and other students who mentor with experts in the students’ fields of study. The mentorships extend the college’s core belief in the importance of mentors in students’ leadership development, Arnold said.  </p>
			<p>The Barton Scholarships are service scholarships awarded to eight students annually who volunteer at Quest Charter Academy, Peoria, where Barton is president of the board of directors.</p>
			<p>The Barton Faculty Fellowships support professional development opportunities and educational experiences for faculty members.  The fellowships are for faculty focused on preparing students for careers in Pre-K through 12th grade education. The fellowships also support faculty projects that address quality of life issues for residents and communities in central Illinois.</p>
			<p>The gift amount has not been disclosed.</p>
			<p>Barton is a member of the Eureka College Board of Trustees and the Ronald W. Reagan Society. He spoke at the college commencement in 2003, when he was awarded the honorary degree doctor of public service. He is a former chairman and chief executive officer at Caterpillar Inc.</p> 
			
			<p>Eureka College has received a bequest totaling $1 million from the estate of J. Neil and Bess Reagan, Ronald Reagan’s brother and sister-in-law.</p>
			<p>The bequest was made public during a meeting of the Eureka College Board of Trustees Feb. 7. The announcement was made in conjunction with the 103rd anniversary of the birth of Ronald Reagan and the 159th Founders’ Day of Eureka College, both which fall on Feb. 6.</p>
			<img src="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/reagan-bequest.jpg" alt="Reagan bequest" width="800" height="445" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6205" />
			<p>“The gift from Neil and Bess Reagan is a testament to the important and enduring relationship between the Reagan family and Eureka College,” said Eureka College President J. David Arnold. “Their love for and generosity towards Neil’s alma mater will allow the couple’s legacy to continue helping future generations experience the same learning, service and leadership opportunities that Neil and Ronald experienced.”</p>
			<p>J. Neil Reagan died in 1996 at age 88. Like his brother, the Illinois native moved to California. He had a career in advertising and marketing, including being a senior producer for CBS and senior vice president of advertising agency giant McCann-Erickson. Bess Reagan died in 2010 at age 102.</p>
			<p>More than 100 objects and photographs from the collection of Neil and Bess Reagan were given to Eureka College and are part of the Mark R. Shenkman Reagan Research Center and Archives in Melick Library.</p>
			<p>Neil Reagan, nicknamed “Moon,” followed his younger brother to Eureka College and graduated in 1933, a year after “Dutch,” as Ronald Reagan was known in his youth. MORE</p>
			<p>The brothers were members of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity and played football. Later, each served several terms on the Eureka College Board of Trustees and helped raise funds to improve and sustain Eureka College. The Reagan Physical Education Center, dedicated in 1970, is named for them.</p>
			<p>The college’s Board of Trustees will determine how to best use the bequest funds, Arnold said.</p>

					<p>Three Eureka College students played an important role in helping area tornado victims get their lives back on track. Serving as case managers with Tri-County Long Term Recovery (LTR), seniors Caleb Friedrich and Megan Watson and junior Cheyenne Ledford helped families meet diverse needs following the Nov. 17 EF-4 tornado that destroyed property in Washington and other areas of central Illinois.</p>

					<p>Eureka College sociology professor Dr. William Staudenmeier suggested the students volunteer with the not-for-profit LTR after learning the organization needed help. Caleb and Cheyenne are sociology and psychology majors; Megan is a psychology major.</p>
					<p>&#8220;The idea was that our students could relieve the burden of routine cases from the professional case managers in order for the overburdened professionals to handle the more complex, longer cases,&#8221; Bill said. &#8220;These three talented students who gave up their summer to become case workers for the families in need are wonderful examples of the call to service for others.&#8221;</p>
					<p>Their work included identifying and prioritizing families&#8217; needs, communicating with insurance companies and FEMA and connecting families with community resources.</p>
					<p>Besides the three students, individually and in groups, Eureka College students have helped from the beginning of the recovery process to now. &#8220;I&#8217;m proud of the volunteer response of our students to this major disaster in central Illinois,&#8221; Bill said. </p>
					<p>Coincidentally, the three students were trained and supervised by Eureka College alumna Alyssa Pollock, who is the regional emergency services director for the Central Illinois Chapter of the American Red Cross. &#8220;In our first contact, Alyssa told me that she was an EC alumna and she knew that any students who we sent would be good,&#8221; Bill said.</p>
					<p>While Cheyenne has finished her work with LTR, Megan and Caleb said they will continue to volunteer. Megan, who is busy settling back in to college life, has several current cases. Caleb has several new cases being assigned to him each week and has closed more than 30.</p>
					<p> &#8220;This experience has affected me on a personal level by opening my eyes to what post-disaster struggles victims of these tragedies encounter, even months after. It has provided me insight into what working in a social work position entails and has made me better prepared in my own personal life, should a tragedy ever befall me personally,&#8221; Caleb said.</p>
					<p> &#8220;Professionally this experience has been significant to my resume by providing me with real-world experience in the social work field and contacts and references that have been beneficial to me as well, even this soon, such as when I met the recently retired president of this area&#8217;s American Red Cross and she knew me by name and was familiar with my work. It has provided me a way to pursue a path that I am enthusiastic about. I have also developed meaningful connections and friendships with those whom I work with and for.&#8221;</p>
					<p>At Eureka College, Caleb is the 2014-2015 recipient of the Donald Anderson Scholarship, named for the sociology and religion professor who taught at EC from 1965 to 1971. Caleb recently began a four-month internship at Kiefer School in Peoria, which provides special education for children who experience difficulty in their home school due to severe emotional, behavioral and learning challenges.</p>

								<div id="panel-spring-break" class="content">
									<p class="first-line">Spring break 2014 may very well be an experience that participants will tell their children and grandchildren about. For the approximately 40 volunteers who spent the week of March 10 performing tornado relief work, it was an inspiring time that lifted their spirits and confirmed the goodness of humankind.</p>
									<p><img align="none" alt="Student spring break in Washington" height="250" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/a0685095a78082e0a0993093c/images/bricks_group.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;border: 0;height: auto;line-height: 100%;outline: none;text-decoration: none;display: inline;" width="400"></p>
									<p>&ldquo;Soon after the Nov. 17 tornado hit Washington, the leaders of the Eureka College Disciples on Campus and Habitat for Humanity student groups that travel on spring break mission trips in and out of the United States voted to forego the usual trip and stay local to work in Washington,&rdquo; said Eureka College Chaplain Bruce Fowlkes. The Disciples on Campus and Habitat for Humanity members were joined by other Eureka College students. In addition, eight youths and adults from First Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in Macomb stayed on campus and worked at the tornado site.</p>
									<p><img align="none" alt="Students work at a tornado site in Washington" height="250" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/a0685095a78082e0a0993093c/images/group_duplex.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;border: 0;height: auto;line-height: 100%;outline: none;text-decoration: none;display: inline;" width="400"></p>
									<p>Plus, 14 students from Eureka College and Western Illinois University joined the Eureka College <a href="http://www.cdopsrnc.com/">Salve Regina Newman Center&rsquo;s</a> tornado relief work headed by the Rev. Eugene Radosevich and Leo Quinn from WIU&rsquo;s St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Newman Center. The group included two WIU exchange students from Africa.&nbsp;</p>
									<p>The Newman Center originally was planning on going to Moore, Okla., to help with tornado clean-up this year,&rdquo; the Rev. Radosevich said. &ldquo;But our neighbors in Washington needed our help.&rdquo; A grant from the local Catholic diocese and donations from benefactors meant that there was no registration fee for the spring break experience, he said.</p>
									<p>The Newman Center group spent much of the week removing snow, straw and debris from the basement of a tornado victim&rsquo;s home. The house was torn from its foundation; even the stairs had disappeared. So the students climbed down a ladder to the debris, shoveled the muck into 5-gallon buckets and passed them up fire brigade-style. In addition to that mighty effort, the group also worked with Threads, Hope and Love in Washington to sort clothes going to families affected by the tornado.</p>
									<p><img align="none" alt="Students clean up debris in Washington" height="250" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/a0685095a78082e0a0993093c/images/debris.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;line-height: 100%;outline: none;text-decoration: none;display: inline;border: 0;height: auto;" width="400"></p>
									<p>The Disciples on Campus and Habitat for Humanity groups had this work schedule:</p>
									<ul class="body-list no-bullet">
									<li>Monday &ndash; Sorted donated clothes at the Washington Tornado Relief Center.</li>
									<li>Tuesday and Wednesday &ndash; Remodeled and painted at a tool library at the Habitat for Humanity ReStore in Peoria. When the library is complete, Habitat homeowners will be trained on the use of tools and be able to borrow them for repairs and improvements. The work was coordinated by Lisa Sheehan, Habitat&rsquo;s Community Relations and Development Coordinator, and a Eureka College alumna.</li>
									<li>Thursday &ndash; Removed snow-covered debris from a young mother&rsquo;s yard, thrown there from surrounding houses destroyed by the tornado. The debris filled a large dumpster, which was less than half of the debris that remained at the two houses sharing the dumpster. The group then went to another house to collect brush from destroyed and cut-down trees.</li>
									<li>Friday &ndash; Using 8-pound sledge hammers, crowbars and wire cutters, the students broke up the fallen brick walls of a garage serving a row of apartments, piling them for removal.</li>
									</ul>
									<p><img align="none" alt="Students work at ReStore" height="250" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/a0685095a78082e0a0993093c/images/re_store.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;border: 0;height: auto;line-height: 100%;outline: none;text-decoration: none;display: inline;" width="400"></p>
									<p>The students did manage to get a little relief from their work. Fellowship activities included indoor rock climbing at Upper Limits in Bloomington. The climbing facility is inside four 6-story grain elevators. The group was trained to belay, or use ropes to climb rocks, and EC&rsquo;s Josh Moore made it to the top (while Chaplain Bruce cheered him on, weak-kneed, from 60 feet below).</p>
									<p align="center"><img align="none" alt="Climbing wall" height="250" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/a0685095a78082e0a0993093c/images/climbing_wall.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;border: 0;height: auto;line-height: 100%;outline: none;text-decoration: none;display: inline;" width="250"></p>
									<p>Funding for the Disciples on Campus and Habitat for Humanity group was provided by the Student Activities Agency of Student Senate, Eureka Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), First Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) of Mt. Carmel and Week of Compassion, the emergency relief agency of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). The funding made the trip free for students.</p>
									<p>Eureka College students helping to organize the trip included Josh Moore, President of the Eureka College Habitat for Humanity Chapter, and Colton Lott, President of Disciples on Campus. Chaplain Fowlkes said, &ldquo;I want to thank Josh and Colton for their excellent leadership with this outstanding project.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>And students did indeed find the experience outstanding. Sophomore Tamara Reese of Naperville observed, &ldquo;It was an incredible experience and rewarding to serve my community and not travel very far to help people in need. I would do it again if I could.&rdquo;</p>
									<p align="center"><img align="none" alt="Students work at ReStore" height="401" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/a0685095a78082e0a0993093c/images/restore2b.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;border: 0;height: auto;line-height: 100%;outline: none;text-decoration: none;display: inline;" width="200"></p>
									<p>Tamara&rsquo;s twin sister, Angela, who also is a sophomore, added, &ldquo;On the mission trip, we did so many little things for the community that will add up and be helpful for many in the future. We were able to have a good amount of fun and fellowship and were able to play a part in the community.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Rachael Wentworth of Kewanee called the experience a blessed opportunity: &ldquo;I just wanted to express thanks for providing the opportunity to do this week of service. I had a blast every step of the way. It was super fun getting to know Chaplain Bruce and his family a little better and making new friends with people I otherwise wouldn&#39;t see too often on campus. I could truly feel God working through all of us this week, and I pray that the people who have been affected by the storm are blessed by the work all of the volunteers do. Thanks sooooooo much for this blessed opportunity for real!&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Truly, then, it was a spring break to remember and to tell others about when recalling how the devastation of Nov. 17, 2013, turned into an example of people blessing others while being blessed themselves.</p>
